<center><article style="color:white;">Mysterious cases are being reported all over the world…
It appears that Viper Circle is the group behind these criminalities. 

According to the CIA’s report, Viper Circle is known as an international corporation operating legitimate
businesses. However, there may be more that lies beneath the corporation’s façade. 

In truth, Viper Circle is a ruthless organization, attracting all criminal forces and activities around the world;
utilizing them for profit. Currently, the force of their organization is so strong,
that the CIA has deemed themselves incapable of handling the notorious group.

Due to their inability to handle such extreme measures, members of the UN have banded together
to form the Global Anti-Terrorist Taskforce formally known as, Peacemaker.

Peacemaker’s mission is to stop Viper Circle, and be the leading force involved in saving the world from future threats.

Tensions begin to boil, as both groups continue to overthrow each other.

To join Viper Circle and dominate the World? Or save the world with Peacemaker?
The war has begun. Which side will you join?</article>
